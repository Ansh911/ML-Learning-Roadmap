# ðŸš€ ML Learning Roadmap (Following Andrew Ng CS229)

This repo documents my 12-week journey of learning Machine Learning using 
Andrew Ng's CS229 lectures + hands-on coding practice.

## ðŸ“… Weekly Progress
- **Week 1:** Linear Regression (Scratch + sklearn)
- **Week 2:** Gradient Descent
- **Week 3:** Logistic Regression (Titanic dataset)
- **Week 4:** Regularization
- **Week 5:** Neural Networks (MNIST)
- **Week 6:** Support Vector Machines
- **Week 7:** K-means & PCA
- **Week 8:** Naive Bayes (Spam Classifier)
- **Week 9:** Ensemble Methods
- **Week 10:** ML Pipelines
- **Week 11:** Mini Project
- **Week 12:** Capstone Project

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle Datasets

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
By the end of this roadmap, I will have implemented core ML algorithms 
from scratch and built multiple ML projects to showcase in my portfolio.
